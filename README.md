# Foresight

## Description
Foresight is a planning mod for GCFW.

It allows you to set ghost building markers on the field that can help make sure you don't accidentally place buildings inside of each other.

This is a mistake-reducing QOL mod, exactly the same results can be achieved without it.


## Known issues
* Right-click drag to remove multiple ghosts at once does not work
* Walls cannot be positioned in top-left corner of 2x2 structures (why would you want this, anyway?)


## Usage
* Press `Ctrl + T/R/A/P/W/L` to show the ghost marker for the corresponding tower type.
* Click to place a permanent ghost marker
* Right click or press the same key combination you used to enter marking mode to exit it.
* Right click on a ghost marker anywhere to remove it

## Installing the mod
### Important warning! Foresight depends on [Bezel Mod Loader](https://github.com/gemforce-team/BezelModLoader).

**To install the mod** grab a release (links below) for your game version. Drop `Foresight-x.x.x-for-y.y.y.swf` into the `Mods` folder in the game's folder (To navigate to the game's folder: rightclick the game in steam -> Manage -> Browse local files).

**If there is no `Mods` folder**, you need to first install Bezel Mod Loader (link above).
